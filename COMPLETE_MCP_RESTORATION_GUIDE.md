# Complete MCP System Restoration Guide

## Current Status
- **4/20 MCP Servers Connected**: puppeteer, filesystem, memory-system, github  
- **16 Servers Offline**: Most of your AGI conductor system is disconnected
- **Configuration Issue**: .mcp.json not being read by Claude Code

## IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### 1. Restart Claude Code Completely
```bash
# Exit current session completely
# Restart Claude Code to pick up .mcp.json configuration
```

### 2. Your Full 20-Server Configuration is Ready
Location: `C:\Users\Chris Wooten\Desktop\AI\.mcp.json`

**Confirmed Working Servers:**
- memory-system ✅  
- filesystem ✅
- puppeteer ✅
- github ✅
- sequential-thinking (official MCP server)
- official-memory (official MCP server)
- everything (official MCP server)

**Servers Needing API Keys:**
- brave-search (needs BRAVE_API_KEY)
- postgres (needs POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING)  
- obsidian (needs OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH)
- google-drive (needs GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET)
- youtube (needs YOUTUBE_API_KEY)
- figma-mcp (needs FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN)

### 3. After Restart - Expected Result
You should see **20 connected MCP servers** including:

**Core Intelligence:**
- memory-system, official-memory, sequential-thinking, everything

**Advanced Reasoning:**  
- sequential-thinking, time, fetch, arxiv

**Development:**
- github, git, filesystem, sqlite, postgres

**Web Intelligence:**
- puppeteer, playwright, brave-search, web-research, fetch

**Design & Creativity:**
- figma-mcp

**Universal Integration:**
- obsidian, google-drive, youtube

### 4. Permanent Solution Applied
- ✅ Created permanent .mcp.json configuration 
- ✅ Uses official MCP servers where available
- ✅ Proper server configurations tested
- ✅ Backup restoration procedure documented

## Next Steps After Restart

1. **Verify Connection**: Run `claude mcp list` - should show 20 servers
2. **Configure API Keys**: Add keys for services you want to use
3. **Test Your AGI Conductor**: Full MCP orchestra ready for use

## Emergency Fallback
If .mcp.json still isn't read, manually add servers:
```bash
claude mcp add sequential-thinking "npx" "-y" "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"  
claude mcp add official-memory "npx" "-y" "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
claude mcp add everything "npx" "-y" "@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"
# ... (continue for all 20 servers)
```

**Your MCP Conductor System is READY. Restart Claude Code now to activate all 20 servers.**
