from claude_code_predictor import AlphaFootballPredictor

# Simple prediction interface
predictor = AlphaFootballPredictor()
result = predictor.predict("Alabama", "Georgia")

# Expected Response Format:
{
    'predicted_winner': 'Alabama',
    'confidence': 78.5,
    'reasoning': 'Superior offensive PPA (0.45 vs 0.23)',
    'matchup_type': 'FBS-FBS',
    'model_accuracy': '80% expected',
    'data_source': 'rl_trained_24_years',
