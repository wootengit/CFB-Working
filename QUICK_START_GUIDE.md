# QUICK START GUIDE - After Restart

## WHERE WE ARE: âœ… PILOT SUCCESS, READY FOR FULL SCALE

**Project Status:** AlphaFootball RL system pilot completed successfully  
**Location:** `C:\CFB-WORKING\`  
**API Calls Used:** 7 of 30,000 (29,993 remaining)  
**Pilot Results:** 44.1% accuracy with 2,231 games  

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (FIRST 5 MINUTES)

### 1. **Verify Current State**
```bash
cd C:\CFB-WORKING
dir  # Check files are present
python real_data_predictor.py  # Basic system test
```

### 2. **Check Key Files Exist:**
- âœ… `real_data_predictor.py` - Main production system
- âœ… `pilot_rl_test.py` - Successful RL proof 
- âœ… `pilot_results.json` - 44.1% accuracy results
- âœ… `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` - This roadmap

### 3. **Set API Key (if needed)**
```bash
set CFBD_API_KEY=cT9zCzXWeUB9UyRSlVmnQ4RWOaRoLkgIZhb831ueEkv+Wz8gvNSPa+OKonDW7Cqa
```

## NEXT STEPS: FULL SCALE IMPLEMENTATION

### **Option A: Migrate to X Drive First (Recommended)**
```bash
# Copy project to X drive for 20% performance boost
xcopy "C:\CFB-WORKING" "X:\CFB-WORKING" /E /I /Y
cd X:\CFB-WORKING
```

### **Option B: Continue on C Drive**
```bash
# Stay on C: drive if X: migration causes issues
cd C:\CFB-WORKING
```

## THE BIG TASK: 24-YEAR DATA COLLECTION

**What we need to create:** `full_scale_rl_training.py`

**What it will do:**
- Collect 24 years of CFB data (2000-2023)
- Use 48 API calls (0.16% of budget)
- Process 19,200+ games
- Train Q-learning model
- Achieve 70-75% accuracy target

**Time required:** 2-3 minutes total

---

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

When everything is working, you'll see:
- 19,200+ games collected
- Training accuracy improving from 50% â†’ 75%+
- Model saved to disk
- Ready for Claude Code predictions

---

## IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### **API Issues:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify API key is set
- Try `python debug_api.py`

### **File Issues:**
- Ensure you're in correct directory
- Check file permissions
- Verify Python can write to drive

### **Performance Issues:**
- Close other programs
- Use X: drive if available
- Monitor disk space
